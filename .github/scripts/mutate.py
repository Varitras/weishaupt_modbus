"""Check that a test actually fails when the code it guards is broken.

A test that passes is not evidence. A test that passes *and* fails when its
fix is removed is. Every worthless test written in this repository so far
passed happily while the feature was broken, and every one of them was found
this way rather than by reading it:

  * a swap test that built the replacement object itself, so it only proved
    the constructor accepts an argument,
  * an abort test whose gate tripped one step too early, leaving the step
    that mattered untested,
  * a reload test that checked THAT a reload happened, not that it saw the
    new data - which is where the bug was,
  * a teardown test that set the flag the production code is supposed to set.

The pattern behind all four: if the test establishes the condition the
production code is supposed to establish, it tests nothing.

The harness itself is held to the same standard. "The tests noticed" is
pytest exit code 1 and nothing else - a usage error, an internal error or an
interrupted run are not evidence, and reading any non-zero exit as success
was this script telling itself what it wanted to hear.

Usage
-----
Describe each mutation in a JSON file - a list of objects with:

    path     file to mutate, relative to the repository root
    old      snippet to replace (must appear exactly once; an absent
             snippet is reported as an error, never skipped silently)
    new      replacement, usually "" or a disabling variant
    tests    -k expression selecting the test(s) that must fail

Then:

    python .github/scripts/mutate.py mutations.json

Every mutation is reverted afterwards, including on failure. Exit code is
non-zero if any mutation SURVIVED - that is, the suite stayed green while the
code was broken, which means the test does not test it.

Cases run several at a time, each in its own copy of the repository under the
system temp directory (`--jobs`, default: cores - 2, capped at 8). Copies
rather than locking, because the thing being shared is a file this script
deliberately breaks. `--jobs 1` skips the copying and works in the repository
itself, which is what to fall back to if a parallel run ever reports
something surprising.

Results are printed in PLAN order regardless, so two runs of the same plan
produce the same output.
