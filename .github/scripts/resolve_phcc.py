"""Pick the pytest-homeassistant-custom-component release to test against.

The test matrix wants "the newest Home Assistant our users can actually be
running". Installing the plugin unpinned does NOT give that: the plugin
publishes a normal, non-prerelease version for every Home Assistant BETA as
well, so `pip install pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` resolves to a
release pinning e.g. homeassistant==2026.8.0b3. pip's own prerelease
exclusion cannot see that - the plugin version is stable, only what it
depends on is not.

The effect is quiet and bad: the job named "current HA" stops covering the
release people run, and a regression against current stable ships green.

So the newest release whose Home Assistant pin is a final version is chosen
explicitly. A literal requirement (the pinned minimum-version entry of the
matrix) is passed through untouched.

Usage:
    python resolve_phcc.py latest-stable-ha  ->  PHCC_SPEC=...==0.13.348
    python resolve_phcc.py 'pkg==0.13.190'   ->  PHCC_SPEC=pkg==0.13.190
