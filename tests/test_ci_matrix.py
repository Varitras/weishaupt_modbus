"""The CI workflow must test the Home Assistant release it claims to test.

A job that installs pytest-homeassistant-custom-component unpinned reads like
"newest Home Assistant" but is not: the plugin ships a normal, non-prerelease
version for every Home Assistant BETA too, so pip resolves to one pinning a
beta. Nothing then covers the release people actually run, and the job stays
green while saying "current HA".

The "minimum" job is the other end: it pins the plugin release that ships
exactly the Home Assistant version hacs.json declares, so an API that does
not exist yet on that release is caught before a user meets it.

Only the selection logic is exercised - no PyPI access, so this stays a fast
unit test rather than a network-dependent one.
