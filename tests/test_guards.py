"""The guards that watch the guards.

Two failure modes threaten a suite of structural guards, and both are quiet:

  A guard goes BLIND. It scans one source file by name, code moves to a new
  module, and the scan keeps passing over the file it still knows. The suite
  stays green about a protection that no longer looks anywhere.

  A guard goes MISSING. Deleting a test is a green diff. Nothing says the
  protection went with it.

So: no test may bind itself to a single package source file, every guard file
has to be listed here by name, and the local check script has to run the same
gates as CI - a local run that promises less than CI is a run people believe
before pushing and should not.
