"""Heuristic guard against narrating comments.

A comment states a decision or a constraint, not what the next line already
says - a narrating comment is noise today and doc-drift tomorrow (the recurring
audit class "comment describes behaviour the code no longer has"). A prose rule
does not reach the moment of writing; this scan does, over the shipped package
and the test suite alike.

ponytail: heuristic with a known ceiling - it flags only the bluntest form, a
comment whose every content word already appears in the adjacent code. A
decision comment carries extra words (why, incident, limit) and passes; the
scan cannot judge meaning, so treat a hit as a prompt to reread and reword, and
exempt only a comment that genuinely earns its place.
