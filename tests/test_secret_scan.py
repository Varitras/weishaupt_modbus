"""The secret scanner still catches a token next to something it is told to ignore.

The allowlist in .gitleaks.toml exists because the generic-api-key rule reads
every `translation_key="..."` in the register table as a credential. Matched
against the whole LINE, that exception also hid a real token that sat on the
same line (reproduced with a synthetic key). It is matched
against the rule's match now - and this test is the proof that a second token
on the line is still reported, and that a plain translation key is not.

Needs the gitleaks binary; the pre-push hook and check.sh need it anyway.
